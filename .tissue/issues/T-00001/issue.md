# Add support for attachments

## Description

When creating bug tickets, we usually want to attach crash dumps, screen shots, logsâ€¦ We probably want to use Git LFS because we surely don't want local mirrors to automatically download, or even contain *all* attachments there ever was for a given project.

Although we shouldn't be overthinking this, I think it might be worth making choices that will > scale reasonably well in the long run.

### [Florian Simon](U001)
Also, it's not a top-priority. There are more important things to do first, such as parsing an issue file, for instance.
